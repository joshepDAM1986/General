This is our "Smart Car Compare" app
It is an application that searches for supermarkets near your location and shows you a list
of prices for each one so you can compare and decide where to make your purchase. To start we
have a presentation on the screen with the logo and a button to enter. As in all applications today,
we need to be registered and identified to be able to use the application. If we do not have an account
we can create one by entering the required information in "create account". We confirm registration and will
proceed to log in. If we already have an account and we forget the password we can recover it from "forgot password"
where we can write our email and an email will be sent to you with instructions to change it."

Main screen:

Once the session has started, we will enter the main page where we are shown the supermarkets near you with a list of
their products, their prices and your current location. Here we can select the supermarket by dragging the image with
our finger and the price list will change to the corresponding one. We can see the complete list of products in "see
all" and we can see our location on the map in the "top" part of the screen.

Supermarket details

We will go to the supermarket details screen where we can see a list of supermarkets available near you and their details
such as their opening and closing hours and their location on the map.We can also see a more complete list in "see all"
